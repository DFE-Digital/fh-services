# Architecture decision records (ADR)

All architectural decisions must be logged within this directory.

To create an ADR: 

1. Make a copy of [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md).
2. Complete the given sections in the template.
3. Submit a pull request to propose the ADR.
4. Work through any feedback until the ADR is accepted or rejected.

Please note that not all technical decisions are architectural decisions. An architectural decision relates to:

- changes at the module (such as dotnet namespace) or component level (structural changes)
- architectural characteristcs (also known as  NFRs or CFRs)
- dependencies
- external interfaces
- construction techniques
