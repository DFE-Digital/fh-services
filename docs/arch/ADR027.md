## Decision

<!-- 
    In a few sentences, describe the decision taken. 
-->

## Context

Part way through 2024, (??) made a feature request to provide end-user metric
and usage reports for the family hubs services (FOR WHO?).

These reports would need to contain, for example:

- the number of organisations recorded
- the number of services stored
- how many searches have been queried

These reports needed be accessible through the 'Manage' service by (???). An
approach for how the reports could be generated and how their underlying data
could be collected needed to be decided.

The approach needed to satisfy the (at the time) scalability requirements of
1000 concurrent users on the 'Find' and 'Connect' services. Accessing the
reports needed to also not exceed the performance requirement of under 3s to
process a request.

## Options considered

<!-- 
    Briefly describe each option considered as a numbered list. Start with the selected option.
    It's usually wise to include a 'do nothing' option.

    e.g.

    1. (SELECTED) PostgreSQL
    2. Oracle
    3. SQL Server  
-->

## Consequences

<!-- 
    For each of the options above, describe positive and negative consequences
    of selecting that option. Create a new section for each option under a heading.

    Remember a law of architecture: There are no solutions, only trade-offs. Make
    sure to include any negative consequences of the selected option.

    e.g.

    ### Option 1 - XXX

    - Consequence 1
    - Consequence 2

    ### Option 2 - XXX

    etc.
-->

### Option 1 - Azure data factory ETL pipeline to generate service-fronted data warehouse

### Option 2 - Introduce a 'user metrics' service and directly query any service-related metrics
