## Decision

<!-- 
    In a few sentences, describe the decision taken. 
-->

## Context

An objective has been set for the FH programme, to be completed by March 2025,
to consolidate the two service directories in the 'Find' and 'Connect' services
into a single directory. 

The existing structure has 'Connect' showing local authority (LA) services and
voluntary, community and faith services (VCFS); whereas 'Find' only shows LA
services. 'Connect' is additionally only available for logged in users who have
been granted access.

The new single directory will show both LA services and VCFS in a public
directory. Existing would then be retired or cut down as necessary. 

An approach for transitioning the directories in 'Find' and 'Connect' to this
single directory and the component changes required needed to be made.

## Options considered

1. (SELECTED) Transform 'Connect' into the new single directory and remove
   'Find'.
2. Build a new component then remove 'Find' and the directory in 'Connect'.
3. Transform 'Find' into the new single directory and remove the directory in
   'Connect'.

## Consequences

<!-- 
    For each of the options above, describe positive and negative consequences
    of selecting that option. Create a new section for each option under a heading.

    Remember a law of architecture: There are no solutions, only trade-offs. Make
    sure to include any negative consequences of the selected option.

    e.g.

    ### Option 1 - XXX

    - Consequence 1
    - Consequence 2

    ### Option 2 - XXX

    etc.
-->

### Option 1 - Transform 'Connect' into the new single directory and remove 'Find'

- The usage of FH services by public users and practitioners would be
  consolidated into one service, making the architecture simpler and cheaper
  to maintain.

- Users of 'Find' would be added to the load of 'Connect'. More users on a
  larger service could minorly impact the elasticity of the FH services, due to
  increased scaling times. However no volume of users has yet appeared to make
  this a likely problem in the near-term.

### Option 2 - Build a new component then remove 'Find' and the directory in 'Connect'

- The new single directory component would not inherit any existing technical
  debt in either 'Find' or 'Connect'.

- The overall cost of development would be far higher.

- Scalability would be partitioned based on usage of the directory and usage of
  the support request features. Could lead to overall better scalability of the
  FH services, compared to merging the usage of the features into a single
  component.

### Option 3 - Transform 'Find' into the new single directory and remove the directory in 'Connect'

- Scalability would be partitioned based on usage of the directory and usage of
  the support request features. Could lead to overall better scalability of the
  FH services, compared to merging the usage of the features into a single
  component.
