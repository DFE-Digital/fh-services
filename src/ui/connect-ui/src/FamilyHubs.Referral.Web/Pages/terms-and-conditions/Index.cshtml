        <p>We might decide not to exercise or enforce any right available to us under these terms and conditions. Doing

            obligations under these terms and conditions to another person unless we agree in writing.</p>
        <p>If any of part of these terms and conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal for any
            reason, the remaining terms and conditions will still apply.</p>
        <p>In the event of a conflict between these terms and conditions and any other terms, including terms and
            conditions on the GOV.UK website, these terms and conditions will take priority.</p>
