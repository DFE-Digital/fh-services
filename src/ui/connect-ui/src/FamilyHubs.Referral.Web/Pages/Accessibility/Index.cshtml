        <p>This accessibility statement applies to Find support for parents, carers and young people service.</p>

        <p>
            This website is run by the Department for Education (DfE). We want as many people as possible to be able to
            use this website.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, that means you should be able to:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA
                and VoiceOver)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>

        <p>This website is partially compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">the Web Content
                Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2 AA standard</a>, due to the following non-compliances and
            exemptions.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>

        <p>
            The content is non-accessible for the following reasons.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the WCAG 2.2 standard</h3>

        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Some links are not sufficiently clear to screen reader users what their purpose is. This fails success
                criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context).
            </li>
            <li>Some expandable content widgets are not accessible for screen reader users. This fails success criterion
                4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.
            </li>
            <li>When focus is received on some interactive elements, colour alone is used to convey information. This
                fails success criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color.
            </li>
            <li>Some headings and labels are not sufficiently descriptive or unique. This fails success criterion 2.4.6

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How we tested this website</h3>

        <p>We have previously tested all pages of the service internally to check they complied with WCAG 2.2 AA. We did
            this using the following accessibility testing tools:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Axe</li>
            <li>WAVE</li>
            <li>Lighthouse</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>An audit was also carried out by <a href="https://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility
                Centre (DAC)</a> to check the service complied with WCAG 2.2 AA.</p>

        <p>Any issues identified have been fixed or added to our list of accessibility issues to fix as soon as
            possible.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

        <p>
            We’ll continue to test the service for accessibility issues, and have created a prioritised list of issues
            to resolve.
        </p>
